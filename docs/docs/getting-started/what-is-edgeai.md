# What is EdgeAI?

EdgeAI is a revolutionary blockchain network meticulously engineered to address the burgeoning needs of the Internet of Things (IoT) and edge computing. It provides a decentralized, high-performance infrastructure for AI-driven applications operating at the network's edge, enabling secure data exchange, processing, and monetization.

At its core, EdgeAI introduces the **Proof of Information Entropy (PoIE) 2.0** consensus mechanism, a groundbreaking approach that moves beyond traditional proof-of-work or proof-of-stake systems. PoIE incentivizes IoT devices to contribute meaningful, high-quality, and novel data to the network, creating a virtuous cycle of data acquisition and validation.

## The Vision

The proliferation of smart devices—from sensors and wearables to autonomous vehicles and industrial machinery—is generating an unprecedented volume of data at the network edge. Centralized cloud models are often ill-equipped to handle this deluge, facing challenges related to latency, bandwidth, cost, and privacy.

EdgeAI's vision is to create a decentralized paradigm where data is processed and utilized closer to its source. By empowering a global network of edge devices, we can unlock new possibilities for real-time AI, predictive analytics, and autonomous systems while ensuring data sovereignty and security.

## Core Components

| Component | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Blockchain Core** | A custom-built blockchain written in Rust, optimized for high throughput and low latency. It manages transactions, state, and consensus. |
| **PoIE 2.0 Consensus** | A unique consensus algorithm that scores and rewards IoT devices based on the quality and entropy of their data contributions. It includes a device registry and data quality scoring system. |
| **Wasmtime VM** | A secure and efficient WebAssembly (WASM) runtime for executing smart contracts. This allows developers to write contracts in familiar languages like Rust, C++, and Go. |
| **P2P Network** | A hardened peer-to-peer networking layer featuring a custom gossip protocol, peer reputation scoring, and robust synchronization mechanisms to ensure network stability and security. |
| **On-Chain Governance** | A fully-featured Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that empowers EDGE token holders to propose, vote on, and implement protocol upgrades and parameter changes. |
| **Staking Mechanism** | A comprehensive proof-of-stake system that allows users to become validators or delegate their stake to secure the network and earn rewards. It includes mechanisms for slashing and reward distribution. |
| **TypeScript SDK** | A developer-friendly Software Development Kit that provides a simple and powerful interface for building applications on the EdgeAI network. |

## Why EdgeAI?

- **Scalability:** Designed to handle millions of transactions per second from a vast network of IoT devices.
- **Efficiency:** PoIE is significantly more energy-efficient than traditional proof-of-work systems.
- **Security:** A multi-layered security approach, including peer scoring, slashing, and a secure WASM environment, protects the network from attacks.
- **Decentralization:** True decentralization at every level, from consensus to governance, ensures a resilient and censorship-resistant platform.
- **Flexibility:** The WASM-based smart contract engine provides developers with the freedom to build complex and powerful decentralized applications (dApps).

EdgeAI is more than just a blockchain; it's a foundational layer for a new generation of decentralized AI and edge computing applications. Join us in building a more intelligent, connected, and autonomous future.
