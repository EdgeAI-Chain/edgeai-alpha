# Introduction to EdgeAI Blockchain

Welcome to the official documentation for the EdgeAI Blockchain, a decentralized network designed to power the future of AI on the edge.

EdgeAI is a high-performance blockchain built from the ground up to support the unique demands of IoT devices and edge computing applications. Our novel **Proof of Information Entropy (PoIE)** consensus mechanism enables secure, scalable, and efficient data validation from a distributed network of devices.

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers, node operators, and users who want to build on, participate in, or use the EdgeAI network.

## Key Features

- **Proof of Information Entropy (PoIE):** A new consensus model that rewards IoT devices for providing valuable, high-entropy data.
- **WASM Smart Contracts:** A powerful and flexible smart contract engine based on WebAssembly, allowing developers to write contracts in languages like Rust, C++, and more.
- **On-Chain Governance:** A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that allows stakeholders to propose, vote on, and implement changes to the network.
- **Staking and Delegation:** A robust staking system that allows users to secure the network and earn rewards by staking their EDGE tokens or delegating to validators.
- **High-Performance P2P Network:** A custom-built peer-to-peer layer with advanced features like peer scoring, rate limiting, and efficient block synchronization.
- **Developer-Friendly SDK:** A comprehensive TypeScript SDK that simplifies interaction with the EdgeAI blockchain.

## Getting Started

- **[What is EdgeAI?](./getting-started/what-is-edgeai.md):** Learn about the core concepts and vision behind the EdgeAI project.
- **[Running a Node](./getting-started/running-a-node.md):** A step-by-step guide to setting up and running your own EdgeAI node.
- **[Using the SDK](./getting-started/using-the-sdk.md):** Get started with our TypeScript SDK to build applications on EdgeAI.
